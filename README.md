# BuilderIO Integration for Magento 2

This Magento 2 module integrates **Builder.io** into your Magento store, enabling you to manage CMS pages and category headings effortlessly with Builder.io's visual editor.

### ðŸŽ‰ HyvÃ¤ compatibility

BuilderIO compatible with HyvÃ¤ theme. No comapatibility module is needed.

### Luma compatibility

It may be needed to run in fallback mode for the editor as we have experienced some issues with the Luma theme and general performace/lag.

## Features
- **CMS Page Integration:** Manage and design your CMS pages directly from Builder.io.

## Local Development
To use this module locally, you need to expose your local environment to the internet. You can use tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [cloudfare tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) to expose your local environment to the internet.

A great article to get you going:
